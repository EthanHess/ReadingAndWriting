//MARK: visualizing threadpools + concurrency

//From Wikipedia

//In computer programming, a thread pool is a software design pattern for achieving concurrency of execution in a computer program. Often also called a replicated workers or worker-crew model, a thread pool maintains multiple threads waiting for tasks to be allocated for concurrent execution by the supervising program.

class GCDVisualizer: UIView {
    
    override init(frame: CGRect) {
        super.init(frame: frame)
        
    }
    
    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
        fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }
}
